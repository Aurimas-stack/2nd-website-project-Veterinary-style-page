# My 2nd website project
The goal for this project was to re-create a website for a "Veterinary clinic" using html, css, javscript/jQuery and php. This time my goal was not to re-create the exact design, so I gave my a little spin to the project. This time the end result was better than the first project in these areas: 
1) CSS - webpage is more responsive, there's a lot of css which makes the webpage a more lively and better looking (for example if you move the mouse on the footer contacts, the sizing, color, shadows changes. There's a basic animation added to forms while you type. And etc.).
2) Javascript - this time there's a little more javascript and jQuery for the purposes of styling, for editing/deleting dynamic content - using AJAX and jQuery.
3) PHP - re-created the usual forms, but this time those forms are in PDO (not mySQL). Created a 'shop' page where you can upload photos with title,description, price. Later you can edit description or the price. Also you can delete the items using by using option from select. 

The end result is not 100% perfect, but I achieved what I've wanted so I'm pretty happy with the end result.
